## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Eriko, computer engineering student, professional athlete and <b>driven </b> programmer <b>fueled </b> by technology and innovation, with a sharp eye for detail and a passion for building exceptional projects.

Some of my projects include:
<br><br>
<h3>Exillion 2D game</h3>
Technologies: Godot, Python, numpy, torch, tensorboard, renpy. <br>
A 2D game developed during a hackaton in 48h alongside 2 teammates, featuring an intriguing plot where life becomes currency, enemies are trained using reinforcement learning and your progress depends on what decisions you take. <br>
Our game won second place from Amazon Games in the Hackitall 2025 event. 
<br><br>
<h3>Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Recognition</h3>
Technologies: GNU Octave, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Supervised Learning, Gradient Descent, Backpropagation, Model Evaluation.
Implemented from scratch a neural network in Octave to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) using supervised learning.
Applied forward propagation, cost function with regularization and backpropagation for gradient computation.
Trained the model using fmincg (conjugate gradient optimization) and achieved class predictions via argmax over sigmoid outputs.
<br><br>
<h3>CLI Image Editor</h3>
A command-line image editor built in C, capable of performing various operations on images, including loading, selecting regions, cropping, rotating, generating histograms, equalizing colors, and applying filters such as sharpen, edge detection, blur and Gaussian blur. The final image can also be saved to disk.
<br><br>
<h3>SortYourself Website</h3>
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python & Flask. <br>
A website that showcases various sorting algorithms, implemented on the backend using Python. The project allows users to understand and visualize how sorting algorithms work in real time, with visual illustrations of the sorting process.
